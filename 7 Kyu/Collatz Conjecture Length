DESCRIPTION:
The Collatz Conjecture states that for any natural number n, if n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. If you repeat the process continuously for n, n will eventually reach 1.

For example, if n = 20, the resulting sequence will be:

[ 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 ]
Write a program that will output the length of the Collatz Conjecture for any given n.
In the example above, the output would be 8.
